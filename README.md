# Ex-4.-Scenario-Based-Report-Development-Utilizing-Diverse-Prompting-Techniques
Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.
## Aim: 
The overarching aim of this experiment is to meticulously demonstrate how the strategic application of different prompting techniques can be utilized to effectively guide and fine-tune an AI model within a specific, real-world retail scenario. The experiment will focus on developing a chatbot, named "RetailGenie," for a hypothetical online fashion and home goods store called "Chic & Cozy."

## Algorithm:
The experiment will rigorously adhere to the following structured, step-by-step algorithm to ensure a systematic, transparent, and fully reproducible approach to chatbot development and evaluation:

**Define Scenario & Input Data:**

Scenario: 
An online retail store, "Chic & Cozy," selling fashion apparel, accessories, and home decor.

Input Data Collection: Compile a comprehensive dataset of realistic customer inquiries. This will include:
Product-specific questions: "What material is the 'Cloudspun Sweater'?" "Does the 'Nordic Throw' come in a larger size?"
Policy questions: "What is your return window?" "How do I initiate a return?" "Do you offer international shipping?"
Order-related questions: "Where is my order #CC12345?" "Can I change my shipping address for order #CC67890?"
General inquiries: "What are your store hours?" "Do you have any physical locations?"
Image Idea: A split screen showing a user typing a question into a chat bubble on one side, and on the other, a stylized representation of data being collected and categorized (e.g., database icons, flowing data streams).
Prepare Diverse Prompting Techniques:
Craft a series of meticulously designed prompts for the AI model, with each prompt specifically engineered to utilize a distinct and representative prompting technique. This allows for a direct comparison of their effectiveness.
Run Experiment on an AI Platform:
Utilize a single, consistent, and powerful AI platform (e.g., a leading large language model API like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 1.5 Pro) to execute all the prepared prompts. This ensures that variations in output are primarily attributable to the prompting technique rather than differences in underlying model architecture.

Evaluate Output:
Implement a robust evaluation framework incorporating both quantitative and qualitative metrics to objectively assess the chatbot's performance for each prompting technique.
Quantitative Metrics:
Response Time: Milliseconds taken to generate a response.
Accuracy Score: Percentage of responses that are factually correct and directly address the user's query (0-100%).
Completeness Score: Percentage of responses that provide all necessary information as requested by the user (0-100%).
Sentiment Score: Automated analysis of the sentiment expressed in the chatbot's response (e.g., using an NLP library to score between -1 for negative and +1 for positive).
Qualitative Metrics (Human Evaluator Simulation): A human evaluator (simulating a customer) will score responses based on:
Clarity & Readability: How easy is the response to understand?
Helpfulness: Does the response genuinely resolve the customer's issue or provide useful guidance?
Tone & Brand Consistency: Is the response friendly, professional, and aligned with Chic & Cozy's brand voice?
Conciseness: Is the response to the point without unnecessary verbosity?
Overall User Satisfaction: A holistic score reflecting the simulated customer's experience.
Image Idea: A dashboard-like display with various metrics (e.g., charts for accuracy, bar graphs for response time), overlaid with icons representing user satisfaction (e.g., smiling/frowning faces).

Analyze & Report:
Perform a thorough comparative analysis of the evaluation results across all prompting techniques.
Highlight the specific strengths, weaknesses, and unique characteristics exhibited by each technique in different inquiry contexts.
Provide concrete recommendations for optimizing prompt design to build a highly effective, production-ready retail chatbot.
Image Idea: A comparison chart (conceptual, not actual data) showing different strengths (e.g., "Accuracy," "Speed," "Tone") with icons representing each AI platform's relative performance, perhaps as small stars or colored bars.


## Prompt:
Scenario: A customer named "Liam" is asking about the return policy for a purchased item.
Prompting Technique 1: Role-Playing Prompting
Description: This technique instructs the AI to adopt a specific persona, dictating its tone, expertise, and communication style. It's crucial for maintaining brand consistency.

Prompt:
"You are RetailGenie, the friendly and helpful customer service chatbot for 'Chic & Cozy,' an online store specializing in fashion and home goods. Your primary goal is to provide clear, concise, and professional support. A customer named Liam is asking: 'What's your return policy for a sweater I bought last week?'"

Output (Hypothetical):
"Hi Liam! Thanks for reaching out to Chic & Cozy. For items purchased last week, you have a 30-day window from the date of delivery to initiate a return. The item must be unworn, unwashed, and have all original tags attached. You can start a return by visiting our 'Returns & Exchanges' page on our website, or I can provide you with a direct link. How would you like to proceed?"
Analysis: This output effectively adopts the friendly and professional tone. It's concise, accurate, and offers a clear path forward for the customer, demonstrating good user experience.

Prompting Technique 2: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Description: CoT prompting guides the AI to break down complex tasks into intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer. This enhances accuracy and reduces hallucinations, particularly for multi-part queries or those requiring logical inference.

Prompt:
"Liam is asking: 'I ordered the 'Velvet Cushion' last month. Can I still return it? My order number is #CC55555.'

Think step-by-step:
First, identify the store's standard return window (30 days from delivery).
Next, determine if 'last month' falls within this 30-day window for order #CC55555, assuming standard delivery times (e.g., delivery on 10th of last month, current date 15th of current month = 35 days).
Then, formulate a polite response, stating whether the item is still eligible for return and why.
Finally, if not eligible, provide alternative options (e.g., store credit, resale advice) if applicable, or politely explain the policy adherence."

Output (Hypothetical - Internal Reasoning followed by Final Response):
(AI's internal thought process):
Step 1: Chic & Cozy's return policy is 30 days from the delivery date.
Step 2: Liam ordered 'last month'. Assuming last month's delivery date was roughly 35 days ago, this falls outside the 30-day return window.
Step 3: The item is likely not eligible for a standard return.
Step 4: Formulate a polite explanation and offer alternatives.

(Final Response to Liam):
"Hi Liam! Thanks for reaching out about your Velvet Cushion, order #CC55555. Our standard return policy allows for returns within 30 days of the delivery date. As your order was placed last month, it appears to be just outside of this window. While we can't process a standard return at this time, we suggest exploring options like selling it on a resale platform or gifting it to a friend. We hope you understand!"
Analysis: CoT ensures a structured evaluation against policy, leading to a factual and well-reasoned (even if negative) response. It prevents the chatbot from incorrectly accepting an out-of-policy return.
